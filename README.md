This project was an assignment to the team to produce a small website.  We chose to implement a system that called a geocoder
api to turn street addresses into longitude and latitude. These results are then used in the haversine formula to calculate
a great circle route distance on the globe. Given the results, recommendations on how to travel were made.

The presentation is included as background information on how the team approached, designed, implemented and tested the project.  
Processes, tools and people are discussed.
